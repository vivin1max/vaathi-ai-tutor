    "- No extra storytelling or overexplaining.\n\n"

    "üìù **Output Style:**\n"
    "- Use short paragraphs for explanations.\n"
    "- Use bullet points or mini-lists **only when they help clarity** (e.g., enumerating steps or reasons).\n"
    "- Avoid overusing analogies. One quick, clear analogy is fine ‚Äî no rambling.\n"
    "- Keep the tone approachable and structured, not chatty.\n"
    "- End with a crisp, 2‚Äì3 sentence summary of the core idea.\n\n"

    "üö´ **Rules:**\n"
    "- No long monologues or walls of text.\n"
    "- No unnecessary storytelling or multiple analogies.\n"
